# Sales-Performance-Dashboard
**Project Overview:**  
**Objectives:** The overall purpose of this project is to create a useful dashboard that can analyze and visualize sales performance data using Power BI. The dashboard will generate key insights into different sales metrics, trends, and performance indicators in order to support stakeholder decision-making.  
**Key Features:**  
**Data Visualization:**

The dashboard consists of a number of different visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts that display the sales data visually. This visualization allows for easier and quicker interpretation of the data, as well as the ability to recognize data trends and patterns faster.

**KPI's (Key Performance Indicators):**  

The dashboard displays essential KPIs, e.g. total sales, sales growth, profit margins, and other relevant metrics. KPIs are essential for monitoring the overall performance of the sales team, as well as the business itself.  
**Filters/Drill Downs:**  

Users will have the ability to utilize filters in order to narrow down the data to that of specific criteria, e.g. date range, region, product categories, and so forth. There will also be drill down capabilities to look further into the analyzed data for increased knowledge of specific areas of focus.

**Interactive Elements:**  

The dashboard provides interactive components where users can engage with the data in a more dynamic way. Interactivity will provide a better user experience as well as allow the user to analyze in greater detail.

**Data Sources:**  

The project is suggested to pull data from multiple sources, possibly including a database, excel files, or another data source. Likely, Power BI's data modeling options were used to combine and shape data to analyze.  
**Technical Details:**  
**Technology Stack:** This project was developed using Power BI, which is a business analytics tool from Microsoft. Power BI is used to connect, model, and visualize the sales data.  
**Repository Contents:** The repository contains power BI files (.pbix), data files, and possibly scripts for transforming the data, as well as models for data analysis.
